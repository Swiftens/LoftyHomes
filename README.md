# LoftyHomes

LoftyDailyRewards is a simple and easy-to-use Minecraft Spigot Plugin that allows players to sethomes.  
Currently, this plugin only allows for a single homes, but multiple will be added eventually.
Main Plugin Version: 1.18.2 (I want to try to allow as much versions as possible)

## Planned Features
* **Message Configuration**
* **A configuration option to teleport on to the center of the block instead of the current location**
* **Multiple sethomes via permissions**
* **Teleportation sounds**
* **Teleportation warm-up and cooldown**
* **Set homes with economy.**
* **Home GUI**
